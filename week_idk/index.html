    <h1>taskbar folder</h1>
    <p>Well this wasn't a very easy app, depending on if it works or not, im writing this page before it got to a working state fully hoping that its going to get there. But you should be able to run this app; doing so creates a folder in the taskbar where you can keep windows to organise your workflow.</p>
